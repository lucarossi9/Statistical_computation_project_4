# Introduction

-----------------


## Abstract

-----------------

In the 21st century **media coverage** is a crucial factor for political figures. As we saw in the recent *Cambridge Analytica* scandal, the public can often be influenced by what they read on newspapers, news websites or social media. Therefore, it could be of primary interest to study and understand **media interest** of different politicians over a specific time period since this interest is capable of affecting the thoughts of billions of people.

## Methods

-----------------

We could have a rough measure of the above mentioned interest by studying **the number of quotes published on newspapers or news websites** referred to a given politician on a given period.
In our analysis we will focus on the years 2015-2017 and we will:
* discuss and analyze the **evolution of the number of quotes** referred to two of the main politicians of the American scene over the past few years: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
* tell the story of the American political scene of those years by comparing it to the evolution of the number of quotes referring to the two politicians; we will identify **which factors caused the peaks** in the number of quotes or a lack of them.
* compare the media popularity of the two politicians over the years 2015-2017.
* compare our results with **Google Trends** to see if the conventional media outlets capture the online interest as well.
* try to understand which are the **main differences between the speakers** whose quotes refer to Trump and the ones whose quotes refer to Clinton. 


## Data in numbers

-----------------

For our analysis we used **Quotebank dataset** and some data extracted from **Google trends**.

# Analysis of the evolution of the number of quotes

-----------------


First of all, let's take a look at the **general trend** of the number of quotes of the two political opponents over the years 2015-2017, feel free to **interact** with the plot to discover useful information. The first question which might arise spontenously is the following: who has the bigger number of quotes ? Does it relate to the politician popularity ?

As we can observe, generally speaking the number of quotes related to Trump is bigger than the number of quotes related to Clinton, but there are some periods in which this is not the case (for example at the beginning of 2015). In addition, as a general trend, we can observe that Clinton number of quotes has decreased a lot from September 2016 until the end of 2017 while the opposite is true for Trump. Which factors are related to this trends ? We will answer this question by describing the main political events in the life of the two opponents during the years 2015-2017, understanding how those events influenced their media popularity.
